# Province Bubblemap in Python

This is a bubble map with a bubble representing each Canadian province.
The map is generated with matplotlib basemap.
The shapefile is from Statistics Canada.

Putting this here in case I have to do something like this again.
Some of the commented out lines can colour each province to generate a heatmap.

Get the shapefile by downloading Cartographic Boundary File for
Provinces/territories from here:
http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2011-eng.cfm

Then place shapefile and associated files in a directory called shapefile
inside the directory contained the ipynb file
